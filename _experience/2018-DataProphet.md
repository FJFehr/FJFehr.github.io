I worked during my summer vacation 2018 as a machine learning engineer intern at a [DataProphet](https://dataprophet.com/)

I worked with a diverse team of machine learning engineers and data scientists. I helped implement transfer learning using RNN and CNN models for financial timeseries data. The key takeaway skills I learned included: 
Using a Linux operating system as opposed to Windows and VIM as an editor. 

Using a git workflow for working in a team. 

Using shell scripts to run experiments and documentation for reusability. 

Learning the value of python as opposed to R. 

Coding in a standard way so that it is easier to review and maintain human readability. 

Setting up virtual environments for python and their importance in industry. 

Working and deploying my machine learning models on Google cloud through SSH.
