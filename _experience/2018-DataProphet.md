I worked during my summer vacation 2018 as a machine learning engineer intern at a [DataProphet](https://dataprophet.com/). I learned to navigate Linux over Windows, use VIM, and work with git in a team. I wrote shell scripts for automation, documented for reusability, and adopted Python over R. Standardized coding improved readability, and I grasped the importance of virtual environments. I also deployed machine learning models on Google Cloud.
