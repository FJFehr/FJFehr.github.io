I worked as a research intern at Amazon, Berlin. Improving retrieval in the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation  with [Prabhu Teja](https://prabhuteja12.github.io/) and [Giovanni Zappella](https://giovannizappella.github.io/)

I designed and trained a lightweight retrieval model for code that incorporates: the semantics of code with dense embeddings; the file directory hierarchy; and the callgraph structure. 

This improved retrieval performance by over 50% over the baseline model and outperformed an LLM agent retrieval system with orders of magnitude fewer parameters.
