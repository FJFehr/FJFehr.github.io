I worked during my summer vacation 2018 as a data science intern at a [Eighty20](https://www.eighty20.co.za/). I wrote SQL scripts for large databases on the Eighty20 data portal, refining my data wrangling, manipulation, and analysis skills. At the same time, I worked in R, building a user-friendly Shiny interface for data clustering. The experience pushed my skills through real-world challenges.
