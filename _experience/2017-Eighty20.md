I worked during my winter vacation 2017 as a data science intern at a [Eighty20](https://www.eighty20.co.za/). I collaborated on a public interest project to visualize South Africaâ€™s water crisis. Using consumption data and dam levels, we built an interactive dashboard that informs users about the current situation.
