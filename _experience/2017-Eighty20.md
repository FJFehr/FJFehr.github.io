I worked during my winter vacation 2017 as a data science intern at a [Eighty20](https://www.eighty20.co.za/)

I worked in a team on a public interest project that created a visualization of the water crisis in South Africa. Using consumption data and dam levels we managed to create an interactive dashboard that visually displays and informs the user about the current situation.
