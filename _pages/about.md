**Experience & Education** I am a final-year PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and a research assistant at the [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en) in the [Natural Language Understanding](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/natural-language-understanding) group, supervised by [James Henderson](https://www.idiap.ch/~jhenderson/). My PhD research explores deep attention-based models and their connection to Bayesian nonparametrics in Natural Language Processing. I hold undergraduate (2018) and master’s (2020) degrees from the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/), specialising in mathematics, computer science, and statistics. In 2024, I was a research intern at Amazon Berlin, working on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation with [Prabhu Teja](https://prabhuteja12.github.io/) and [Giovanni Zappella](https://giovannizappella.github.io/).

**Personality** I believe in leadership by example. I see honesty, humility, and kindness as the ultimate optimizations—free to give, invaluable to receive. Passionate and tenacious in research, I prioritise progress direction over magnitude. My happiest state? Rigorous mental stimulation, relaxed social interaction, and regular outdoor exercise. For leisure, I find joy in nature - sunshine, the sea, and snowy mountains.

**[February 2025]**
I wrote my first blog post! It's a reflection on my research internship at Amazon and living in Berlin. [Interning at Amazon Berlin 2024: the Grind, Growth, and Gratitude](https://fjfehr.github.io/fablogio/research-internship-at-amazon-berlin/)


**[December 2024]**

Completed my research internship at Amazon, Berlin. They are tackling ambitious, unsolved problems, building AI agents to assist software engineers. I worked in improving retrieval for code editing agents. Special thanks to [Prabhu Teja](https://prabhuteja12.github.io/) and [Giovanni Zappella](https://giovannizappella.github.io/)!


**[November 2024]**

Presented at the 30 years of Neural Networks Festschrift for [Dr. James Henderson](https://www.idiap.ch/~jhenderson/). The talk was a light-hearted story of my PhD journey. See the [slides](https://FJFehr.github.io/files/Jamie Festschrift.pdf).
