I am a PhD candidate of the EDEE department at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and research assistant at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en), in the [Natural Language Understanding](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/natural-language-understanding) group under the supervision of [Dr. James Henderson](https://www.idiap.ch/~jhenderson/). My current work involves understanding deep attention-based models and their connection with Bayesian nonparametrics for natural language processing. I received both undergraduate (2018) and masters (2020) qualifications from [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) with specializations in statistics.
