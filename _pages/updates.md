## 2022

**[July 2022]**   
Our paper [A Variational AutoEncoder for Transformers with Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13529) is on Arxiv.

**[May 2022]**   
Attended ACL Conference.

**[March 2022]**   
Our paper [HyperMixer: An MLP-based Green AI Alternative to Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03691) is on Arxiv.

**[Spring Semester]**   
Passed the course [Human language technology: applications to information access](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/human-language-technology-applications-to-information-access-EE-724?). This course allowed for fine-tuning skills in NLP and provided a more holistic picture of current research space.

**[February 2022]**   
Successfully passed my candidacy exam. I am officially a PhD candidate of the Electrical Engineering Department of EPFL.

## 2021

**[Autumn Semester]**   
Passed the course [Scientific programming for Engineers](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/scientific-programming-for-engineers-MATH-611#:~:text=Summary,complexity%2C%20optimization%20and%20program%20designs.). This course provided fundamentals in code development and practical applications in C++.

**[Autumn Semester]**   
Passed the course [Deep Learning For Natural Language Processing](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing-EE-608). This course gave good grounding in NLP and allowed for a group project which will hopefully lead to a publication.

**[April 2021]**   
Attended EACL Conference virtually.

**[February 2021]**
Joined the Natural Language Understanding group under the supervision of Dr. James Henderson at the Idiap Research Institute as a research assistant.

**[January 2021]**   
Completed my MSc in Statistics at the University of Cape Town. My MSc thesis: [Modelling non-linearity in 3D shapes: A comparative study of Gaussian process morphable models and variational autoencoders for 3D shape data](https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/35725).
