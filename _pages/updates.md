<!--<li><span style="color: black">[November 2019]</span><br> Blah blah add papers-->

<li><span style="color: black">[July 2022]</span><br>  Our paper <a href=" https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13529"> A Variational AutoEncoder for Transformers with Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck </a> in on Arxiv.

<li><span style="color: black">[March 2022]</span><br> My first paper <a href="  https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03691"> HyperMixer: An MLP-based Green AI Alternative to Transformers </a> on Arxiv.


<li><span style="color: black">[May 2022]</span><br> Passed the course <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/human-language-technology-applications-to-information-access-EE-724?"> Human language technology: applications to information access</a>. This course allowed for fine-tuning skills in NLP and provided a more holistic picture of current research space.

<li><span style="color: black">[February 2022]</span><br> Successfully passed my candidacy exam. I am officially a PhD candidate of the Electrical Engineering Department of EPFL.

<li><span style="color: black">[February 2022]</span><br> Passed the course <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/scientific-programming-for-engineers-MATH-611#:~:text=Summary,complexity%2C%20optimization%20and%20program%20designs."> Scientific programming for Engineers</a>. This course gave a grounding in programming fundamentals and practical applications in C++.

<li><span style="color: black">[February 2022]</span><br> Passed the course <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing-EE-608"> Deep Learning For Natural Language Processing</a>. This course gave good grounding in NLP and allowed for a group project which will hopefully lead to a publication.

<li><span style="color: black">[February 2021]</span><br> Joined the Natural Language Understanding group under the supervision of Dr. James Henderson at the Idiap Research Institute as a research assistant.


<li><span style="color: black">[December 2020]</span><br> Completed my MSc in Statistics at the University of Cape Town. My MSc thesis: <a href="https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/35725"> Modelling non-linearity in 3D shapes: A comparative study of Gaussian process morphable models and variational autoencoders for 3D shape data</a>.
