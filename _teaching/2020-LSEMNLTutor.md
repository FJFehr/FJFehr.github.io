I work part-time during my studies with the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) as a tutor for online course [Machine Learning: Practical Applications](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/online-learning/courses/machine-learning-practical-applications)

Takeaways
======
I helped with subject matter for an online Machine Learning course. The skills learned:  Applying dimension reduction and clustering methods for difficult real world datasets. Interpretations with applications for business. Thereafter, I work as an online tutor guiding students through difficult concepts in statistics and machine learning. This requires a proficiency in R for the selected techniques covered in the course.
