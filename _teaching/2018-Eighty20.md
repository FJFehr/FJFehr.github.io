I worked during my summer vacation 2018 as a data science intern at a [Eighty20](https://www.eighty20.co.za/)

Takeaways
======
I worked on writing SQL scripts for large databases for the Eighty20s data portal. This tested knowledge of data wrangling, manipulation and analysis. Concurrently I worked in R and focused on creating a user friendly interface in shiny to cluster data. All in all my skills were tested and stretched in real work examples.
