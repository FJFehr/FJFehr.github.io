Takeaways
======
This course teaches doctoral students to form a research question and conduct research using the scientific method with applications to NLP community. My role was to supervise three independent research groups with projects in the intersection of NLP, speech and vision. I also have presentations on software tools for NLP and discussion sessions of the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs).
